    "Why am I so excited about Complex Systems Science? Well, for a very long time, including much of my childhood (starting with Conwayʻs Game of Life on an Apple IIc!) I have been fascinated with automata. I spent endless hours in University of Michigan computer lab (which was invariably freezing cold) toying with my own versions in Pascal and C, sometimes to the detriment of my actual homework. \n",

    "Many years later, a couple of events caused those old interests to flicker back to life. More and more of my work has focused on AI in the past few years, and with the advent of AI large language models (LLMs), I began experimenting a bit with automata. The following code is something I prototyped in early 2024, asking ChatGPT to please output the first few steps of a basic, well-known computational system:"

The other one was: I currently work for American Samoa Community College, which, as of December 2024, was working to establish remote courses for the Pacific market.[2] As the manager of our technology integration effort, I signed up for ASUʻs online courses simply to gather competitive intelligence. Thatʻs right: Iʻm a mole.\n",

    "To that end, I have begun work, with Professor Applegateʻs guidance, on an Agent Based Model based on the classical Lotka Voltera ecological system of formulae. We are applying AI in an effort to answer a research question: \"Do LLM agents produce emergent system-level stability or new behavior in a well-known dynamic model?\" One might conjecture that the proof of concept illustrated above leads me to think that the answer could be, \"yes.\"\n",
