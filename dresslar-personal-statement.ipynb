I spent endless hours in University of Michigan computer lab (which was invariably freezing cold) toying with my own versions in Pascal and C, sometimes to the detriment of my actual homework. \n",

    "Many years later, a couple of events caused those old interests to flicker back to life. More and more of my work has focused on AI in the past few years, and with the advent of AI large language models (LLMs), I began experimenting a bit with automata. The following code is something I prototyped in early 2023, asking ChatGPT to please output the first few steps of a basic, well-known computational system:"

I expect that beyond ecology, we might find particular success investigating traditional problems from economics, sociology, and perhaps even the pursuit of science itself. That would naturally connect with the kinds of research being produced, for instance, at the ASU-SFI Center for Biosocial Complex Systems, or perhaps Decision Theater, among other research efforts at ASU.\n",

    "In summary, I feel that my experiences with computational models, my track record in public-sector technology deployments and service, and my ongoing agent-based modeling research align perfectly with the mission and research areas of the Complex Systems Science MS at ASU. I feel that I can contribute immediately to the program by networking with like-minded students within and around ASU. I hope to continue my research into the future. And, I would be delighted to contribute, using my background in higher education, program development, and fundraising, to help the program with sustainability, should that be of interest to leadership there."

    "I'm the founder and executive director of Pacific Broadband and Digital Equity, where I work with community anchor institutions across the Pacific region to improve digital access. My background spans technology leadership, government service, and entrepreneurship—including roles as Commonwealth Broadband Lead for CNMI and Territorial Broadband Coordinator for American Samoa, where I secured over $125 million in federal funding. Previously, I founded Elevada Inc., a data services company serving pharmaceutical clients, and served as Adjunct Faculty at the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy. My technical expertise includes full-stack development, cloud infrastructure, and AI systems. I'm particularly interested in how modern technology and complex systems can address societal challenges, which has led me to explore the intersection of agent-based modeling and artificial intelligence in my recent work.\n",

    "\n",
    "[1] [Deepseek R1](https://www.deepseek.com/) can sometimes get Rule110 correct past ten steps. [Claude Sonnet v3.7](https://console.anthropic.com/workbench) can sometimes get to about step eight unscathed, and its \"reasoning\" outputs are enlightening, but Anthropicʻs rate limits can be challenging. A more formal investigation might be of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "[2] I recognize that characterizing what LLMs do as \"thinking through\" rather than \"computing\" may be controversial. My position is that when an LLM correctly executes Rule 110 without being explicitly programmed to do so, it's engaging in a form of reasoning that's qualitatively different from traditional algorithmic computation. The model isn't executing a hardcoded Rule 110 algorithm; it's using its learned representations to simulate the rule's behavior—a process more akin to how humans reason through problems than how traditional computers execute instructions. This distinction becomes important when considering the implications for complex systems modeling, where emergent behaviors often arise from simple rules applied through distributed cognition rather than centralized computation.\n",
