    """
I study the causal roots of complex phenomena and the mathematical formalisms that describe them. Of particular interest to me is
 the degree to which large language models can change and possibly accelerate our pursuit of identifying 
universal principles across systemsâ€”from biological regulation to social dynamics. I am also a fan of software engineering practices and tools
that make scientific investigation more accessible and reproducible.
